# Click on game object
This example shows a possible way of simplifying click handling on game objects with sprites. The example uses a Lua module to keep a list of clickable game objects and their sprites and takes into account size and scale when detecting clicks.

Depending on the situation it might be better to solve hit/click detection using collision objects, as seen in [this example](https://github.com/britzl/publicexamples/tree/master/examples/click_and_drag).

# Disclaimer
This example only works well with the default stretch projection. The example will not work if the projection is fixed.
